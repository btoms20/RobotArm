# AnninRobotics v4 Robot Arm   
   
Hi! üëã
 
This repo is home to all the notes, thoughts and future plans I have for my build of the amazing [AnninRobotics v4 robot arm](https://www.anninrobotics.com). Below, you'll find some basic info covering some of the physical and electrical attributes of the arm and the software stack used to control it; There's also a TODO list of features I'm hoping to add in the near future.  

If you have any questions or comments, feel free to post on the [discussions board](https://github.com/btoms20/RobotArm/discussions)! üôã
   
## ü¶æ Structure
- [AnninRobotics v4 Design & Kit](https://www.anninrobotics.com)
- 6 axis robot arm, aluminum core with 3D printed cosmetic panels
   
## üß† Logics   
- Duet 3 6XD running RepRapFirmware with custom IK code    
- DWC interface with http gcode server exposed
   
   
## ‚úÖ TODOs   
- [x] Mechanical Build
- [x] Control/Junction Box (panel cutouts, air vents, estop, board brackets, etc)
- [x] Electronics (cable routing, wiring, soldering, etc)
- [x] Electronics (endstops and encoders)
- [x] Software Basics (provision Duet 3 6XD)
- [x] Software Basics (external drivers configured, steps/deg, speed, accel)
- [x] Software Basics (homing files, homing sequence)
- [x] Open loop control (all 6 axis working)
- [x] End Effector (servo gripper installed, configured and running)
- [x] Upgrade J2 to new [higher precision gearbox](https://www.anninrobotics.com/post/j2-gearbox-update) (https://github.com/btoms20/RobotArm/discussions/2) 
- [x] Get robo viewer plugin set up on DWC   
- [x] Change DWC from mm to deg (our config is doing everything in mm, it would make more sense if we started using degrees instead)   
- [x] Enable Closed Loop Control (https://github.com/btoms20/RobotArm/discussions/3)
- [ ] [Joint Encoders](https://github.com/ongdexter/ar3_hardware_mods) as well
- [x] Get IK set up    
- [x] Software based backlash compensation (3.5 - M425)
- [ ] Use accelerometer to fine tune ee pose
- [ ] Install Panel Due on front of junction box
